    - EXTRAS:
        -> TODO: Add tensorboard training results (plots).
            -> Modify to be at higher resolution.
        -> TODO: Photos
            -> With the Headset and all components.
            -> From BrainViz, and from EmotivPRO.
        -> TODO: README.md
        -> Create image to show similarities between the GAN-generated data and the original
            -> Like in `file:///C:/Users/aghinea/Downloads/electronics-12-02216-v4.pdf`
            -> Automatic Emotion Recognition from EEG SignalsUsing a Combination of Type-2 Fuzzy and DeepConvolutional Networks


Cross-Corpus:
- Load SEED-V and do cross-corpus
- They don't consider different labels => Do experiment where I have multiple labels

Data Augmentation Techniques:
- GAN
- phase-shifting
- time-warping -> Paper: "EEG time-warping to study non-strictly-periodic EEG signals related to the production of rhythmic movements"

Graph Convolutional Network:
- Try others than the K-order Chebyshev graph convolution
