- To speak about in bachelor thesis
    - Chapter 1 Introduction
        -> TODO: Add motivation, objective
        -> TODO: Abstract
        - 1.3 Theoretical Background
            -> TODO: Write about transformers, maybe other stuff you see in the model.
    - Chapter 3 Methodology
        - 3.2 Custom Dataset Creation
            -> Fine-tuning using that data
        - 3.3 Data Preprocessing
            - 3.2.2 Data Augmentation
                - GAN-based Augmentation
                    -> ADD DETAILS ABOUT HOW MUCH DATA WAS ADDED
        - 3.4 Model Architecture
            -> TODO: Create diagrams.
    - Chapter 4 Project Planning and Management
        -> TODO: Add a SWOT

    - EXTRAS:
        -> TODO: Add info about GAN:
            -> Related Work: "SleepEGAN: A GAN-enhanced ensemble deep learning model for imbalanced classification of sleep stages"
            -> Add much more details about the GAN as now it's more complex
        -> TODO: "Proposed Solution" section should be much more concise.
        -> Create image to show similarities between the GAN-generated data and the original
            -> Like in `file:///C:/Users/aghinea/Downloads/electronics-12-02216-v4.pdf`
            -> Automatic Emotion Recognition from EEG SignalsUsing a Combination of Type-2 Fuzzy and DeepConvolutional Networks
        -> TODO: README.md
        -> TODO: Photos
            -> With the Headset and all components.
            -> From BrainViz, and from EmotivPRO.
        -> Tensorboard training results (plots).
            -> TODO: Modify to be at higher resolution.


Cross-Corpus:
- Load SEED-V and do cross-corpus
- They don't consider different labels => Do experiment where I have multiple labels

Data Augmentation Techniques:
- GAN
- phase-shifting
- time-warping -> Paper: "EEG time-warping to study non-strictly-periodic EEG signals related to the production of rhythmic movements"

Graph Convolutional Network:
- Try others than the K-order Chebyshev graph convolution
