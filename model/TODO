- To speak about in bachelor thesis
    - Chapter 1 Introduction
        - 1.2 Proposed Solution
            -> Update with GAN
            -> Update with better details about EPOC X
            -> Don't use JCFA when I'm talking about the architecture of the model, use my model name "EmotionWave"
        - 1.3 Theoretical Background
            -> Add about the K-order Chebyshev graph (Reference at `Chebyshev [30]`), as I did the code implementation myself
    - Chapter 3 Methodology
        -> Add a `Data Collection` section
            -> About the data collection from the EMOTIV EPOC X
            -> Fine-tuning using that data
        - 3.2 Data Preprocessing
            - 3.2.2 Data Augmentation
                - GAN-based Augmentation
                    -> ADD DETAILS ABOUT HOW MUCH DATA WAS ADDED
        - 3.3 Model Architecture
            - NT-Xent (the normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss)
            - Self-supervised Pre-training
                -> Time Domain Contrastive Learning
                -> Frequency Domain Contrastive Learning
                -> Time-Frequency Domain Contrastive Learning
            - Supervised Fine-tuning
                -> Graph Convolutional Network
                -> Emotion Classification



- Innovations:
    - Advanced Data Augmentation Techniques:
        - GAN
        - phase-shifting
        - time-warping -> Paper: "EEG time-warping to study non-strictly-periodic EEG signals related to the production of rhythmic movements"
    - Graph Neural Networks Enhancements:
        - Something other than `K-order Chebyshev graph convolution`
    - Hyperparameter Optimization:
        - Bayesian Optimization
        - Hyperband
    - Explainability and Interpretability: SHAP, LIME
    - Multi-modal Fusion:
        - Integrate additional physiological signals (e.g., visual stuff from SEED)
    - Transformer-based Enhancements:
        - (BERT, GPT-style transformers) to improve the encoding of time and frequency domain signals.




Cross-Corpus:
- Load SEED-V and do cross-corpus
- They don't consider different labels => Do experiment where I have multiple labels

Graph Convolutional Network:
- Try others than the K-order Chebyshev graph convolution
