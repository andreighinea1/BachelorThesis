Automatic Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals Using a Combination of Type-2 Fuzzy and Deep Convolutional Networks:
	- Preprocessing:
		- Notch Filter
		- Butterworth Filter
		- Segmentation
		- Data Augmentation (try with GAN)
	- model (CNN):
		- Using type-2 fuzzy functions as the activation function of a convolutional layer. These are used to design systems with high uncertainty and complexity.
		- Using large filters in the first layer
		- Using small filters in the middle layer
	- Training:
		- Search for many parameter combinations in a search space:
			Optimizer
			Loss function
			Number of Convolution layers
			Number of FC layers
			Number of Filters in the [1st, 2nd, other] convolution layer
			Activation Function
			Size of filter in the [1st, other] convolution layer
			Dropout rate
			Batch size
			Learning rate
	- THOUGHTS:
		- Try to train a larger CNN, then get output from intermediary layers, see if it's better than completely shrinking the model (do that dynamically).
